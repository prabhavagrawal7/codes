During my internship at Rubrik, I contributed significantly to the Rubrik Security Cloud (RSC) by developing new features primarily using frontend technologies like TypeScript, React, and Apollo for GraphQL.

Key Contributions:

1. Rubrik Cloud Vault Integration:
   - Developed a feature to use archival location as Rubrik Cloud Vault for persistent backup.

2. Hyper-V Offline Recovery Flow:
   - Wrote the entire recovery flow for Hyper-V, including recovery and live mount tabs and SCVMM settings tab.

3. Concurrent Mode Enablement:
   - Adapted existing components to be compatible with React's concurrent mode.
   - Fixed test cases that were incompatible with concurrent mode.
   - Conducted thorough testing to identify and resolve any potential flow disruptions.

4. Component-Level Issue Resolution:
   - Resolved issues at the table component, particularly involving mimicking GraphQL to REST APIs.
   - Simulated the behavior of GraphQL (Apollo) query updates and loader states when directly consuming REST APIs from the table.
